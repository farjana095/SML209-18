<tr><td> Catalan shares the ‘L’ of Portuguese </td><td> Valencian don't </td><td> Even though the languages is exactly the same when written, the pronunciation of these two languages is far too different.Valencian speakers have trouble with this L, which exists in the Portuguese word for ‘woman’, for example: mulher. In English, the closest sound is the ‘L’-ish sound you make in the word million.</td></tr>
<tr><td> Catalan has stress-marked vowels that change </td><td> Valencian vowels are more neutral</td><td>For example, the word “teléfon” in Catalan has one stressed vowel (marked by the accent) and two unstressed vowels. When the ‘e’ is not stressed, in Catalonia it is pronounced ‘uh’. The unstressed ‘o’ is pronounced ‘u’ or ‘ooo’. Tuh-lay-foon. While in Valencia, it is always pronounced in a neutral sound. Ta-la-fon. </td></tr>
