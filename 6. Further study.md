<h1 style="color:mediumvioletred;" align="center">What to visit in Catalonia?</h1>

<button class="accordion">A Guide for new visitors!</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Bordered by the mountains and the Mediterranean Sea, Catalonia is a traditional region of Spain that is fiercely proud of its unique culture. Barcelona is the most-visited destination. This colorful seaside city is full of attractions and things to do, with an atmospheric medieval quarter, surprising modernist architecture, and a vibrant urban culture. Rivaling Barcelona in historic importance are Girona, with its medieval heritage, and Tarragona, a former Roman capital. Farther afield, in the idyllic countryside of verdant valleys and gently rolling hills, tourists can discover quaint medieval towns, picturesque seaports, and quiet country villages where chirping birds and church bells are the loudest noises. The Catalan coast delights sun-worshippers with seaside destinations such as the upscale resort of Sitges and the secluded coves of Cadaqués on the Costa Brava and the calm waters of the Costa Daurada. Every stop along the way, the local gastronomy will tempt visitors. Be sure to try local specialties like Esqueixada, a salad of peppers, tomatoes, and salt cod.</p></div>

<button class="accordion">Sitges</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Along the Mediterranean Sea, just 42 kilometers from Barcelona, Sitges lures visitors in search of golden beaches and pampered seaside relaxation. The town has a "Blue Flag" beach with calm waters ideal for swimming. A yacht marina and golf courses add to the resort ambience. Sitges also offers culture; its historic center has two lovely churches, the Iglesia de Sant Bartomeu and the Iglesia de Santa Tecla. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many Spanish Modernist monuments were built throughout the town. An excellent example of this avant-garde Modernist architecture is the Cau Ferrat where famous Spanish author and artist Santiago Rusiñol lived. His home and art studio became a gathering place that attracted many artists and intellectuals, giving the town a Bohemian atmosphere. For those who appreciate gourmet cuisine, Sitges has much to offer. The town has an abundance of renowned restaurants that serve superb gastronomic cuisine, especially dishes of the Catalan region.</p></div>

<button class="accordion">The costa Brava</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Stretching north east from the coves and beaches of Blanes to Catalonia's border with France, the Costa Brava is Spain's most beautiful coastline. This 1,240-mile coast of ragged cliffs and idyllic beaches is one of Europe's favorite seaside playgrounds, and its pretty little whitewashed towns have lured artists that include Dali, Picasso, and Marc Chagall. Sandy beaches, like the one at the colorful old fishing village of Calella de Palafrugell, are tucked into coves beneath the cliffs, and other towns, such as Santa Susanna, have a choice of several beaches, from busy strands filled with sunbathers and kiosks to quiet coves and beaches equipped for watersports and sailing. Whatever your taste in beaches, you're sure to find it somewhere along the Costa Brava.</p></div>
  

<button class="accordion">Tarragona</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Tarragona is a beautiful seaside city that seems to have it all: sunshine, beaches, and interesting historic monuments. About 100 kilometers from Barcelona, this port town on the Costa Daurada is a worthwhile excursion or an alternative base to explore Catalonia. Beach lovers will be content spending a few days here. Most of the city overlooks the Mediterranean Sea, and the spectacular Playa del Milagrobeach is within walking distance from the historic center of town. History buffs will be enthralled by Tarragona's UNESCO-listed ancient Roman buildings found all over Tarragona, especially the incredibly well-preserved Roman amphitheater of the second century. The city also has a charming Romanesque-era cathedral and medieval streets. For a delicious seafood meal, stroll over to El Serrallo - the old fishing village that has an atmospheric Old World ambience.</p></div>
  

<button class="accordion">Banyoles</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>This idyllic retreat in nature is just 18 kilometers from Girona and 121 kilometers from Barcelona, near La Garrotxa Nature Reserve. Surrounded by the green rolling hills of the Sierra Rocacorba, the town is nestled between two rivers on the shores of Lake Banyoles. Banyoles has an ancient history, with an important textile industry since the 13th century. In the town's quaint old center are several interesting religious monuments: the 14th-century church of Santa María del Turers and the Neoclassical monastery of Sant Esteve. Other important landmarks are the Pia Almoina, a medieval mansion built in the 14th century that houses an Archaeology Museum, and the Llotja del Tint, a 15th-century building that was used for dyeing textiles. A highlight of visiting Banyoles is the beautiful lake with a six-kilometer perimeter. It's a wonderful place to relax, take nature walks, cycle, or go boating. Tourists may rent small boats for rowing, kayaking, or canoeing. Fishing is another popular pastime, with rewarding catches to be found in the pristine waters.</p></div>
  
<button class="accordion">Girona</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>A sparkling gem of historic Catalonia 103 kilometers from Barcelona, this medieval walled city has a rich cultural heritage with diverse influences from the ancient Romans, Moorish-era Arabs, and Jews. The Old Town was built on the right bank of the Onyar River with colorful houses flanking the waterside. Girona has two areas enclosed within ancient ramparts: the Força Vella, which outlines the original Roman city founded more than 2,000 year ago, and the Medieval Quarter, which expanded the city in the 14th and 15th centuries. These atmospheric historic quarters are filled with narrow pedestrian streets and impressive medieval buildings. The fortress-like Romanesque cathedral was built in the 11th century and updated through the 17th century. The facade is Baroque and the interior is Gothic. The massive nave is the widest medieval sanctuary in Europe. Among the artistic masterpieces displayed in the sanctuary is a Catalan textile of the Romanesque era called the Creation Tapestry. Other important religious monuments are the 12th-century Benedictine monastery de Sant Pere de Galligants; the Romanesquechurch of Sant Nicolau, now used as an exhibition room; and the medieval Gothic convent of Sant Doménech surrounded by beautiful gardens.

The main drag of the Old Town is the Rambla de la Libertad, an arcaded pedestrian street lined with shops and pavement cafés. Another interesting area to explore is the Jewish Quarter (El Call), one of the best preserved in Spain. During the Middle Ages, this quarter had an important synagogue and centers of Kabbalist study. The squares of Placa del Oli and the Placa del Vi have maintained their original ambience. Near the Jewish quarter, visitors can uncover the cultural legacy of the Moors. The Arab Baths, now housed in a Capuchin convent, feature a pavilion of Islamic-style columns topped with an octagonal cupola.</p></div>
