<center><h2 style="background-color:darksalmon;"><a href="https://farjana095.github.io/SML209-18/1.%20About%20Catalonia.html">1. About Catalonia</a></h2></center>

<div>Here, I will be only pointing out few facts about the history and culture of Catalonia, a presentation will be presented (also, a fun a gif illustrating some Catalans who want independence), a bar Chart showing in which places is Catalan spoken today and then 2 exercises to test what’s been learnt.</div>


<center><h2 style="background-color:darksalmon;"><a href="https://farjana095.github.io/SML209-18/3.%20Catalan%20vocabulary.html">3. Catalan vocabulary</a></h2></center>

<div>This section is mainly about Catalan vocabulary, it is important that the potential visitor familiarises himself a bit with the accent of Catalan Language, and even though I can’t put here all the words that exists in Catalan, I did put the months of the year in Catalan (with an audio recording too, so that readers knows how to pronounce), numbers, and a video about some of the typical foods. After each section, I have designed activities to test reader’s knowledge after each section is learnt.</div>

<div>In this section I have designed an accordion, where there are many expressions about Catalan Language that are used by visitors who are very experienced with the language. After this, I have designed a flash card activity, where the Reader will be presented with Catalan phrases and he will have to guess what it means in English, this will include an audio recording with it too, so that the Reader gets familiarised with the accent too, then he can turn the flash card to see the English meaning. There will also be a fill in the gap activity.</div>


<center><h2 style="background-color:darksalmon;"><a href="https://farjana095.github.io/SML209-18/5.%20Notable%20Catalan%20Artists.html">5. Notable Catalan artists</a></h2></center>
